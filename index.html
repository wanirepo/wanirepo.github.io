      <span style="font-size: 14px !important; color: #777;"><p>How does the brain represent, process, and regulate pain and affective experiences? My research goal is to answer the research question to provide a better understanding of pain and emotional distress, and eventually a better help for our lives, our families, and our neighbors suffering from those.</p>
      <p>Pain and emotion are crucial for human beings to survive and thrive, and are primary factors shaping human behavior and decisions. Despite their importance, studying pain and emotion has been challenging because of their subjective, elusive nature. I approach this problem using neuroimaging techniques, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), combined with various psychological and computational techniques.</p>
      <p>Functional brain measures, which show the brain <i>in action</i>, can offer important, unique contributions to making pain and emotion visible by providing their objective measures (i.e., biomarkers). Functional neuroimaging-based biomarkers for pain and emotion could support better assessment, diagnosis, and prognosis and provide a rich window through which we can integrate psychological knowledge with neuroscience and medicine. Therefore, my research primarily focuses on developing fMRI-based biomarkers for pain and emotion (and relevant clinical conditions) using machine learning and other advanced statistical methods, such as network modeling (Wager et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2014).</p>
      <p>My research also focuses on the neural mechanisms of the top-down, psychological influences on pain (Woo et al., 2015). Pain is more than just responding to noxious, external stimuli. For example, severely injured soldiers in a battle report minimal or less pain than normally expected. Conversely, some chronic pain patients report intense pain with no evident physical cause. Psychological factors such as expectation, placebo, distraction, and reappraisal can effectively change pain experience, as used in various forms of psychotherapy for pain. Further, pain is a multi-dimensional experience with sensory, cognitive, and evaluative aspects. Therefore, identifying the brain systems representing each aspect and understanding top-down influences on the multiple brain systems are crucial for assessing what type of pain patients have and predicting which type of therapy will be effective, and will eventually help accomplish my long-term research goal, establishing a foundation of the personalized medicine for patients suffering from pain and emotional distress.</p></span>
