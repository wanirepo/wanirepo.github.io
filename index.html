Wager) at the University of Colorado Boulder. Choong-Wan's research focuses on understanding how the human brain represents, processes, and regulates pain and emotions. His recent publications span the topics from <a href="#NEJM2013">developing neuroimaging-based biomarker for pain using fMRI</a> to <a href="#PLOS2015">understanding the neural mechanisms of cognitive self-regulation of pain</a>.  Recent research focuses on quantifying cerebral contributions to pain above and beyond external, nociceptive input. He has received many awards including the <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">Fulbright Graduate Study Award</a> from Korea and US government, the Carol B.

      <p>How does the brain represent, process, and regulate pain and affective experiences? My research goal is to answer this research question to provide a better understanding of pain and emotional distress, and eventually a better help for our lives, our families, and our neighbors suffering from those.</p>
      <p><b>FMRI-based biomarker:</b> Functional brain measures, which show the brain <i>in action</i>, can offer important, unique contributions to making pain and emotion visible by providing their objective measures. Neuroimaging-based biomarkers could support better assessment, diagnosis, and prognosis and provide a rich window through which we can integrate psychological knowledge with neuroscience and medicine. My research primarily focuses on developing fMRI-based biomarkers for pain and emotion (and relevant clinical conditions) using machine learning and other advanced statistical methods, such as network analysis (Wager et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2014).</p>
      <p><b>Pain regulation, Emotion regulation:</b> My research also focuses on the neural mechanisms of the psychological influences on pain (Woo et al., 2015). Pain is more than just responding to noxious stimuli. For example, severely injured soldiers in a battle report minimal or less pain than normally expected. Conversely, chronic pain patients report intense pain with no evident physical causes. Psychological factors such as expectation, placebo, distraction, and reappraisal can effectively change pain experience, as used in various forms of psychotherapy for pain. Pain is also a multi-dimensional experience with sensory, cognitive, and evaluative aspects. Therefore, identifying brain systems for different aspects of pain, and understanding the neural mechanisms of the top-down influences on pain are crucial for assessing chronic pain patients and predicting which type of therapy will be effective. This line of research will eventually help accomplish my long-term research goal, establishing a foundation of the personalized medicine for patients suffering from pain and emotional distress.</p>
      <p><b>Translational research:</b> In spite of growing interests in using neuroimaging as predictive tools (i.e., biomarkers) for the clinical purpose, such tools have not yet made their way into clinical practice. However, given the potential uses of fMRI-based biomarkers in multiple aspects of prevention and treatment—such as risk and symptom assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, drug discovery, and more—efforts to discover neuroimaging-based biomarkers have been expanding. Particularly, recent advances in human neuroimaging, combined with machine learning techniques, are bringing us closer to the goal. However, translations from basic research to clinical use have been more difficult and slower than initially expected. Indeed, a big gap, sometimes called the ‘valley of death’ (Butler, 2008), between basic and clinical research is common across fields, and neuroimaging appears to be no exception. My research focuses on facilitating bidirectional "translations" (bench-to-bedside and bedside-to-bench) by developing a new approach, a predictive mapping approach, to study human cognition, emotions, and clinical conditions (Woo et al., in preparation).</p>
      <p><b>Machine Learning, Network Analysis, Natural Language Processing:</b> To accomplish the goals that are mentioned above, interdisciplinary efforts are necessary. By pursuing dual PhD both in <a href ="http://www.colorado.edu/ics/">Cognitive Sciences</a> and <a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/">Psychology/Neuroscience</a>, I found great interests in sub-fields of Computer Science, such as machine learning, network analysis, and natural language processing, and it became apparent that these techniques are crucial to solve my research problems. I developed my knowledge on these topics by taking classes (e.g., <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/">CSCI 5352</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/teaching/CSCI_5622/">CSCI 5622</a>) and actually using them in research (e.g., Woo et al., 2014). I truly believe that these techniques will serve building blocks in my future research.</p></span>
